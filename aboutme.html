        <p class="para1">Hello! My name is Diana. I am 14 years old and I'm
        a freshamn in highschool. I play soccer. My favorite position
        to play is forward becuase you run the most and get to score
        goals in the games. I also like doing makeup just for fun. 
        I also love dancing. My favorite genere of music to dance 
        to is bachata because its a free dance no rules to it than just 
        having fun dancing it. As in personality, I'm a very happy person.
        I don't like being sad. I like being happy and loud and well yeah,
        I'm a very optimistic person too.</p>
